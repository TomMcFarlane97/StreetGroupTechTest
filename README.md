Street Group Tech Test

Please note, this is an idea of how I would code. It is more psuedo code and an idea as to how I like to structure my code.
Requirements to run this tech test

- php 7.4
- Composer
- Command Line Interface

## How it is built
- Slim framework version 4

## How to get started
- Run `composer install`

Tom McFarlane's Tech Test is running off the local php server. To run the server, 
- `php -S localhost:8000 public/index.php`

All the requests come through public/index.php

## Useful commands
- `composer install` - install composer.
- `composer phpstan` - run PHP Stan (Static Analyser tool.)
- `composer phpcs` - Run PHP Coding Standard and ensure they are being met. It is currently set to PSR12 standards.
- `php ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/unit` - Run Unit tests.

### General Comments 

I think it is self-explanatory how I have set up the project and every single Class has its own function. 
It is all split out into their own directories with relevant naming.
To upload a CSV you will need to look at requirements in `public/endpoints.md`. 
Note - I would normally use Swagger for this. 

### Just to give an overview

- public - anything that is public facing.
- src - all logic and code belongs here.
- tests - all tests are here.
- vendor - all composer and third party dependencies.

##### Inside src directory

- Controllers - all the endpoints are configured to accept data from a request and to then return a response.
- Entities - map of the database tables.
- Exceptions - custom exceptions to give a better knowledge of what is going.
- Processes - Where a "process" should have the logic and should always return a form of a result object. 
  This makes it interchangeable whether it is executed from an endpoint or through the CLI. 
Makes the code more reusable if it was to be used through the CLI.
- Repositories - The section that communicates with the Database.
- Repositories/Interfaces - Where all Repository interfaces are.
- Services - Where all business logic is handled.

Please note for the API side, I would have added in bearer token validation, ensuring it came from the right IP address.
The same for the unit tests. I only wrote tests for the Service just to demonstrate the point that I can do it.
